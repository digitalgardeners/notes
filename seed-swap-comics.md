# The prompt

Find a comic, and write a note that is about, inspired by, or in response to that comic. Make sure to include the comic in your note. Some good places you might find inspiration:

- For almost everything, but a lot of coding, [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/)

- For the wackiness of everday social life, [Poorly Drawn Lines](http://www.poorlydrawnlines.com/)

- For leftist U.S. political commentary, [The Nib](https://thenib.com/)
