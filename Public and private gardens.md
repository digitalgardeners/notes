> It's interesting you define digital garden as public-readable.

> **Anne-Laure**
> Yes actually I don't know if that's necessary, now that you mention it. But to me part of the benefits of a digital garden is to invite continuous feedback from fellow gardeners, hence why some people use [[webmention]]s and hypothes.is to add a meta-layer of commentary

> **Bill Seitz**
> I agree public is important. I think everyone needs both public and private spaces.

> **Rosano**
> Perhaps 'second brain' or 'exocortex' prefers private, whereas 'digital garden' prefers public (or at least sunlight).
> 
> **Bill Seitz**: I'm now framing private/public as Inner and Outer Digital Gardens.
