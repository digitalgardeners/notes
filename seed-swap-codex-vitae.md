# Inspiration

Codex Vitae is Latin for 'book of life.' It's a place where you write down your beliefs and assumptions in order to make yourself more thoroughly aware and critical of what they are. The practice can also be valuable in tracking the changes in your beliefs over time.

The 'beliefs' you enumerate don't need to be in any specific area. It may be how you think about:
- work
- leisure
- food
- money
- social life
- your hobbies

Or any number of other topics. The important thing with a Codex Vitae is to be **honest** and create time to reflect.
