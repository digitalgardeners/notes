# The concept

Gardeners who have experience as writers might be familiar with the concept of a [30 for 30](http://longriverreview.com/blog/2018/how-to-conquer-this-years-national-poetry-month-the-30-for-30-challenge/) or [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) (that's National Novel Writing Month, for the uninitiated.)

Even #Entrepreneur #ContentCreators have caught onto the trend, as evidenced by [Ship 30 for 30](https://ship30for30.com).

Whatever you want to call it, the concept is simple: write every day. And since writing every day is hard, write every day with other people around to act as your [accountability buddies](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/well/live/habits-health.html#:~:text=Choose%20a%20friend%20who%20wants,on%20a%20decluttering%20project%20together.).

Applying this to digital gardening has some obvious upsides:
- create lots of content
- put your content in conversation with others'
- have novel ideas for notes/posts

# The execution

Rather than write every single day (because that's tough), our group of digital gardeners will be trying a weekly exercise wherein we generate a handful of prompts every week and write to as many of those prompts as we have the bandwidth for.
