# The prompt

This may sound vague, but there are probably a lot of people whom you follow online (or irl) that deserve a bit of real-estate in your garden. Let's give them that. There's a few different ways to approach this prompt:

### Personal page

Write about yourself! Give visitors to your garden an opportunity to understand you a little bit better. Go beyond the typical resume/CV stuff and get into your personal interests and WHY you're digital gardening.

### Role model 

Whom online or IRL do you revere? Give this person a page in your garden, and use it as an opportunity to explore how you could better write/code/exist *like they do*. The page should tie easily to other notes of yours, since it's likely you've written before about processes/philosophies/etc. that they live by or espouse.

### Creator bio

Write (either impersonally or with a lot of your own views injected) about somebody who makes content that you really enjoy! This could be anything: a comedian, songwriter, another digital gardener, a tech writer, whatever. Add ample links to your favorite stuff of theirs, explain why they're good at what they do, learn a little bit more about their background and history.
