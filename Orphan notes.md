A note that isn't linked to any other notes.

## Is it OK to have orphan notes?

Some people prefer not to - e.g. [Do not keep orphan notes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/do-not-keep-orphan-notes).
Maybe you have an orphan note for a short period - but eventually you do tidy it up as part of your regular [[wiki gardening]].

> I prefer to try to link to actual notes, but sometimes it’s hard. For instance when I start exploring a new area.
> In such cases I add them to my “ideas” page, which also acts as a kind of an index of the various topics I have notes on and as the entry point to my garden.

> **Aakarsh**: The latest update on [[Obsidian]] seems to be facilitating just this. Nick Milo does what he calls as #workbench - a kitchen table of sorts to work with ideas, connect, clean, discard etc. Check this out: [https://youtu.be/L8ymPug8GjE](https://youtu.be/L8ymPug8GjE)

> **phil**: I just automatically generate a page of orphans ... http://thoughtstorms.info/view/OrphanPages

> The other thing to remember about orphans is that they aren't necessarily born that way. Many orphan pages on ThoughtStorms are orphans because a page linking to them was deleted or edited.

> **neil**: For tools with a [[graph view]] that can be one way to discover orphan pages while gardening.  (Though a list page is obviously much more practical, if your tool has it.) https://commonplace.doubleloop.net/2020-05-03

> **Bill Seitz**: Some people like a RandomPage feature. You could make a RandomOrphan feature.
>
> **neil**:That could just be part of a regular wiki gardening habit. Perhaps tools like Roam that encourage the use a daily page, could have an option to add a checklist to your daily page, of X random orphan pages you should have a look at and try and link, or clear out if no longer useful.
>
> **Fabrice Liut**: You can do it in Roam with Query.
>
> **Bill Seitz**: Another idea: whenever a page you're looking at (say, from a Search) is an Orphan, that could be noted loudly on the first line, to nudge you.
>
> You could also just not worry about orphans. Like letting stuff fall off your ToDoList. If it matters it will come up again.
>
> A cousin of Orphans is [[Missing Pages]]: phrases double-bracketed on (multiple) pages for which there is no page. Usually these are generic entities, but not always
>
> **Anne-Laure**: I set up my TiddlyWiki to automatically create double bracketed pages like Roam does.

> This way at least there's a node even if it's empty
